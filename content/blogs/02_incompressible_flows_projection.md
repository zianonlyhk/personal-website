# Abstract

This is the content of my blog post. You can write in Markdown format here. Let's add some mathematics! For example, the quadratic formula states that if $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, then $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.

## Mathematics Examples

Here's Einstein's famous mass-energy equivalence equation:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

And here's the beautiful Euler's identity:

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

## Some Calculus

The derivative of a function can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$
