# I met her in my sushi bar

The autumn of 2022 marked the beginning of the last academic year of my study in the UK.
I was about to narrow my interests in maths and physics down to the field of computational fluid dynamics.
I then met the beast of Navier-Stokes&apos;.
She looks very much like Newton's dog, but with tentacles sprouting from her back.

I decided to chop off her tentacles and ask my Japanese cohort classmate for some sushi tips.
Here's what I cooked up:

<!-- two gif outputs of my code -->
<!-- explain that they are the compressible and incompressible form of the NS equations. -->

## What if I want to put those tentacles back?

<!-- Explaining the NS equations and how to get the compressible and incompressible equations. -->
