## To my future self

If I want to add a new project, I can add it to the `content/projects` folder as a new markdown file.

If I want to add a new blog post, I can add it to the `content/blog` folder as a new markdown file.

If I want to add a new image to the gallery, I can add it to the `public/gallery` folder. I need to then go to the `src/app/gallery/page.tsx` file and add the image to the `galleryItems` array.

If I want to edit the about page, I should edit the `src/app/about/page.tsx` file. There is no easy way to do it.
